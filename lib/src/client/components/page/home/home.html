          <p>We're making it easier for people and organizations to assemble, discover and share resources, and coordinate their efforts to affect real world
          change.</p>

          <p>We are a collaborative generation, presiding over massive shifts in how humanity works together, but the tools we use are still
          not optimized to support us. Social networks were built for sharing, not for coordinating our efforts and
          getting things done.</p>

          <p>Imagine how much more effective we can be when our tools are consciously designed to
          support collaboration and encourage action.</p>
