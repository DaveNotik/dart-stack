dart-stack
==========

A simple Dart stack I'm experimenting with. No server code whatsoever.

### Components

- Polymer.dart <–– custom elements, aka Web Components
- Polymer core-elements <–– some rad elements
- AngularDart <–– framework with routes, MVC and more
- angular_node_bind <–– Polymer<–>Angular bi-directional data binding
- firebase.dart <-- simple db in the cloud (replace with your own URI)

### Known issues

- dart2js has an issue with core-scaffold; remove that element before building
